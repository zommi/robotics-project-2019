Description of files inside the archive:

Inside the archive there will be an src folder containing 2 packages: project2 and the complementary filter package.
Inside the project2 package there will be , apart from a CMakeLists.txt file and a package.xml file, an src folder containing the node publishing the odometry, a launch folder containing the launch file for the project and a params folder containing the params for both ekf filter and navsat. The complementary filter package source code has been modified to meet our needs.

How to start the nodes:

	-Compile the package
	-run the bag file with the flag --clock
	-run the launch file with "roslaunch project2 launcher.launch"

In our tests we found that it may be necessary to run a rosclean purge before running the launch file.

Parameters used:
To set up the parameters in the yaml files we followed a template we found in the documentation of the libraries.

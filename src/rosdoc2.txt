Description of files inside the archive:

Inside the archive there will be an src folder containing 2 packages: project2 and the complementary filter package.
Inside the project2 package there will be , apart from a CMakeLists.txt file and a package.xml file, an src folder containing the node publishing the odometry, a launch folder containing the launch file for the project and a params folder containing the params for both ekf filter and navsat. The complementary filter package source code, cloned from the official repository, has been modified to meet our needs.

How to start the nodes:

	-Compile the package
	-run the bag file with the flag --clock (the nodes use simulation time)
	-run the launch file

We added some static transforms in the launch file, as well as the load commands to read the yaml files from the params folder, that have been set up by following the doc.
